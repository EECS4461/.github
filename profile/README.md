## 🔍 About the Project


### ⚡ **Phenomenon of Interest**

Automated bots engage in Xiaohongshu’s comment sections, promoting ads, counterfeit products, and even services like fortune-telling. These bots evolve rapidly, constantly adapting to moderation strategies, which leads to an **ongoing cat-and-mouse game** with platform security systems.

### 🔑 **Key Dynamics We Explore**

1. **Keyword-Based Information Extraction:**  
   Bots detect sensitive keywords (e.g., *“shipping”*, *“logistics”*) to target specific posts.

2. **Automated Advertising & Fake Engagement:**  
   Bots create deceptive promotional content, sometimes posing as satisfied customers to boost credibility.

3. **Coordinated Interaction for Credibility:**  
   Bots engage in scripted conversations to create an illusion of organic, genuine discussions.

4. **The Arms Race:**  
   As moderation systems improve, bots adopt new evasion techniques:
   - **Adversarial Content Generation:** Context-aware word substitutions (e.g., *"sh!pping"* → *"shipping"*)  
   - **Dynamic Detection Evasion:** Using reinforcement learning to predict moderation updates  
   - **Countermeasure Adaptation:** Moderation AIs employing graph-based detection and behavioral fingerprinting  
   - **User-AI Symbiosis:** Human users inadvertently mimic bot-like patterns in their own behavior

## 🎯 Goals for the Project

- ✅ Simulate bot behaviors and moderation strategies on Xiaohongshu  
- ✅ Analyze how bots evolve to bypass content moderation  
- ✅ Model the feedback loop between bot evolution and detection algorithm upgrades  
- ✅ Provide insights into the effectiveness of current moderation techniques

## ⚡ Fun Fact

Did you know?  
Bots on social media can sometimes **mimic human behavior better than real users**—but they still can't decide what to eat for breakfast. 🥐☕
